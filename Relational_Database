So we need to create a relationship between the User table and the BlogPost table to link them together.
So we can see which BlogPosts a User has written. Or see which User is the author of a particular BlogPost.

n relational databases such as SQLite, MySQL or Postgresql we're able to define a relationship between tables using
a ForeignKey and a relationship() method.

e.g. If we wanted to create a One to Many relationship between the User Table and the BlogPost table,
where One User can create Many BlogPost objects, we can use the SQLAlchemy docs to achieve this
